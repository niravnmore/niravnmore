Greetings of the day!!...

Thank you for visiting my page.

Currently working as a freelancer for QA and PHP backend development projects. 

I have been working with the software industry for last 8 years mostly in a capacity of a Quality Analyst. I have acquired developer skillset in last couple of years mainly in PHP, cakePHP and Laravel.

I have worked with several domains such as banking, social networking, video streaming, gambling, gaming, etc.

I am always curious to explore new opportunities.

I am currently revisiting my developing skillsets with frontend, nodejs and reactjs.

Happy to colaborate!!

Thank you for your time.
